## Electronics Tutorial :baby:

### Basics Before Engineering

* [Go through if completely new and curious](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLah6faXAgguOeMUIxS22ZU4w5nDvCl5gs)



### Beginning Electronics -(Learing fundamentals of electronics)
If your goal is to pursue research in electronics, go thourgh theoritical sections well. Or if you are more likely to learn by doing projects, you sould start with above link (Basics before engineering) and then jump in Practicals section. Do research theoritical aspects as you go into depth and have any confusion and vice-versa.
Also for practical section you will need additional programming knowledge, that you can get from programming-tutorial and programming-books section of this repo.
In the end both paths combine to create some awesome Engineering Project/Write some research!
###### Happy Learning :)

#### Practicals (and hands on projects)

* [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

From now onwards your and mine project interest can be quite diffrent and also I have not explored all possibel fields, Obviously..The field is so broad.

Thus, I am sharing the resources I know, you can search for things of your interest and add the resources here too!

* [Tensorflow](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOzRYVm0a65cTV_t0BYj-nV8VX_Me6Es3)


After knowing this much, you will be self sufficient to search for and learn new things. 
This will help you for kickstarting your learning journey. :wink:

___*Also, I will recommend learning Data Structure and Algorithm and core programming as it is where most of the creativity for your projects and learnning will come from.*___

Thanks!
